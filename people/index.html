                        In the era before mugshots, the gazette had to describe the suspects (if known) as accurately as possible, and some of the descriptions are almost poetic. But they also follow some conventions, so they usually start with the age and height, then their build, hair colour, eye colour, facial hair (if applicable), what they wore, and then any distinguishing features such as scars, tattoos, limps, manner of speech etc. By looking at the rate at which certain terms are mentioned over the years, you can see some of the changes that occur. Again, this method is not perfect: just because the description doesn't mention a striped shirt, the type of boots they had on, or the style of hat they were wearing, it doesn't mean they <em>weren't</em> wearing them, merely that it was not recorded.</p> 

                        <p>For example, based on the descriptions in the gazette, tattoos seem to descriptions become more common after 1880, but this could be due to other factors, such as say, the result of a directive to make sure that any tattoos were recorded in the descriptions (albeit one only gradually adhered to).</p>
                            
                        <div class="inline" data-term="tattoo"></div>
                            
                        <p>I'm not saying this was the case, merely that just because a term's use increases or decreases, it doesn't automatically follow that the change is solely due to it being more or less common at the time, as there may be other factors involved as to why it was recorded more (or less) in the gazette.</p>
 
                </div>

                <div class="b">

                    <p>Similarly, certain terms seem to wax and wane over time. For example, descriptions of people being of 'larrikin appearance' only occurred once before 1882 (in <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/252052989?searchTerm=%22larrikin%20appearance%22">1874</a>) but then became much more popular after that, and then fell away again after that.</p>

                    <div class="inline" data-term="larrikin appearance"></div>

                    <p>
                        Also, perhaps not surprisingly, the gender in the gazette skews male (see the graph under 'Gender' below), which in turn means that men's clothing and attributes are more mentioned than women's in the descriptions of the suspect(s).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So although there's all sorts of things that can be inferred from the data, without looking at other data sources and information, we can't be sure that what's being inferred is correct. And like any form of data entry, there's bound to be errors and mistakes in the descriptions, but my hope is that the sample size is large enough, and over a long enough period, that, especially for some of the more common traits and descriptions, what you are seeing is a genuine reflection of change (this applies to the sections on 'places' and 'things' as well).

                    <h3>Racism</h3>

                    <div class="cols">
                        <div class="a">
                            <p>
                                Since its inception, white Australia has stolen from others - land, children, lives, autonomy, wages - aided and abetted by the law and the institutions that enforce it, such as the police. As part of the official - albeit internal - communications of an organ of government, the terms and language used in the gazette shows us some of the attitudes of the times. Given what we know about the period, it probably hardly needs pointing out that racist attitudes were held by many within the NSW police. If the gazette contains offensive descriptions and terms such as <em>'blackfellow'</em> (32), <em>'the blacks'</em> (49), <em>'Chinaman'</em> (2,023), <em>'half-caste'</em> (816), <em>'Kanaka'</em> (23), and <em>'large Jewish nose'</em> (6), it is reasonable to assume that these views were not out of step with many of its officers. As the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/IndigLRes/rciadic/">Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</a> notes, in the section 'The Importance of History':
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <em>
                                    "Police officers naturally shared all the characteristics of the society from which they were recruited, including the idea of racial superiority in relation to Aboriginal people and the idea of white superiority in general; and being members of a highly disciplined centralist organisation their ideas may have been more fixed than most"
                                </em>
                                <sup>2</sup>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After all, one of the first acts of the newly formed federal government in 1901 - led by New South Welshman Edmund Barton - was to pass the Immigration Restriction Act, better known as the White Australia
                                policy, the legal embodiment of racist attitudes stretching back generations. It was Barton himself who said:
                            </p>

                            <p><em>"The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishman and the Chinaman."</em> <sup>1</sup></p>

                            <div class="inline" data-term="Chinaman"></div>

                            <p>
                                This racism was particularly evident in the descriptions and reporting of crimes that involved Aboriginal people. A whole range of offensive terms appear, especially in regards to Aboriginal women, such as
                                <em>'gin'</em> (17) and <em>'lubra'</em> (4). Plus we know - as did many at the time - that
                                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2019/mar/04/massacre-map-australia-the-killing-times-frontier-wars">massacres of Aboriginal men, women and children</a> had been occurring since colonisation, including over the period covered by this project (1860-1900).
                            </p>
                        </div>



                        <div class="b">

                            <p>
                                To take just one example of how these attitudes of racial superiority, and the lesser value put on the lives of Aboriginal people may have manifest themselves in the gazette, compare the number of murders
                                reported where the <em>suspect</em> was Aboriginal and the victim was non-Aboriginal with the number of murders reported where the <em>victim</em> was Aboriginal and the suspect was non-Aboriginal. Here you
                                see quite a difference, especially when considering the population composition at the time. The murders of Aboriginal people by non-Aboriginal people were reported at around half the rate of murders of
                                Aboriginal people by non-Aboriginal people (see 'Selective Reporting' below). Given we know that there were entire <em>massacres</em> of Aboriginal people not reported, this suggests that individual murders
                                of Aboriginal people by non-Aboriginal people were perhaps under-reported as well.
                            </p>

                            <!--<div class="inline" data-term="murder"></div>-->

                            <p>
                                In addition to this, in cases where the suspect(s) in the murder of Aboriginal people were non-Aboriginal, 25% were acquitted or discharged (2 of 8 cases), and in 38% of cases bail was allowed (3 of 8 cases).
                                On the other hand, in the 15 cases where the suspects were Aboriginal, there were no mentions of cases being discharged, nor any mention of acquittals, and in the sole case where it was noted that bail was
                                allowed, the individual was later <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/252089755?searchTerm=Turner">re-arrested and the initial charge upgraded from manslaughter to murder</a> on the
                                instructions of the Attorney General.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There were also at least 3 cases where an Aboriginal suspect was shot and killed by NSW police, shown by the blue circles in the graph below (the 4th in 1900 was when <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/251631474">Joe Governor was shot by John Wilkinson</a> after the government offered a £2,000 reward for their capture). In one case an inquiry was held, and the policeman in question was <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/252052975">"charged with manslaughter</a>, though this was later overturned in a subsequent inquiry, and the constable
                            </p>

                            <p><em>"discharged from custody, with credit for his courageous conduct".</em></p>

                            <p>There were also an additional five incidents where the victim was Aboriginal, but the suspect was unknown.</p>
